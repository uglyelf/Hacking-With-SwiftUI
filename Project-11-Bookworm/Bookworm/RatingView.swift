         The problem is that when we have rows inside a form or a list, SwiftUI likes to assume the rows themselves are tappable. This makes selection easier for users, because they can tap anywhere in a row to trigger the button inside it.

         In our case we have multiple buttons, so SwiftUI is tapping them all in order â€“ rating gets set to 1, then 2, then 3, 4, and 5, which is why it ends up at 5 no matter what.

         We can disable the whole "tap the row to trigger its buttons" behavior with an extra modifier attached to the whole HStack:
         .buttonStyle(.plain)
         */
        HStack {
            if !label.isEmpty {
                Text(label)
            }
            
            ForEach(1...maximumRating, id: \.self) { number in
                Button {
                    rating = number
                } label: {
                    image(for: number)
                        .foregroundStyle(number > rating ? offColor : onColor)
                }
            }
        } // HStack
        .buttonStyle(.plain)
    }
    
    func image(for number: Int) -> Image {
        if number > rating {
            offImage ?? onImage
        } else {
            onImage
        }
        
    }
}

#Preview {
    RatingView(rating: .constant(4))
}
